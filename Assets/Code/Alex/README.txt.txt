Hi Dr. Bc

This is the primary folder for the scripts of my feature. The customers.

Essentially, the customers will eventually path to and from tables and places orders. They will have at least
2 interactions with the player by both placing an order and receiving and order.

If the order is incorrect something bad will happen.

For the minimum viable product, I created a customer that starts out of the restaurant and paths to a table.
