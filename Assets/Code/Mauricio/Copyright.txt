The item being taken is the beef and chicken from the popular game Minecraft. 

1) I argue that in our project the subject is being transformed in purpose. 
It does not fullfill the same purpose as in Minecraft. In Minecraft it is an
item that is obtained from killing a cow. Then this food item is shown in a 3D 
enviornment. It then can be picked up by the player to be eaten/cooked. In our game
the food item is obtained from a fridge. It then can be moved by the player to be cooked order
thrown away. It also cannot be eaten by the player it can only be eaten by customers in the 
the restaurant. The sprites have been changed in purpose and presentation. it is no longer in
a 3D enviornment instead a 2D enviornment. It can be obtained through a fridge as opposed to killing
an animal. 

2)My second reason that this falls into fair use is that the sprite is a minor factor
in the game itself. It is not the focus of the game. It is an accessory to the game. 
There is a hunger feature in Minecraft but its not the reason people Minecraft for. In our game
it is the same way people do not play the game to see the sprites they play it to give the customer 
the food. The food could look anyway and it would still function the same way. There fore it is not 
the "heart" of the game.
