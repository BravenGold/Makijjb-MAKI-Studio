My feature is the point system and the kitchen/food side of the game.

I feel as though all three tie in together because the food will have
a point attached to it. The food also interacts with the kitchen in order 
to have a cooked product. 

MinimalViableProduct: I added a very simple point system where there is 
a square object and it detects if it is collided with. If it is then a point
is added to the score. It only works with player because of the player tag.
